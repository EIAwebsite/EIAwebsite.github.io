<h1 align="center" style="font-size: 45px;"> About Us </h1> <br>

<h2 style="font-size: 35px; margin-left: 30px; color: #5e2b97;"> OUR MISSION </h2>
<p style="font-size: 22px; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> Western Engineers In Action (WEIA) aims to provide isolated communities with safe access to
services and opportunities by building footbridges over impassable rivers. Working under our
parent organization, EIA, students are connected to real world civil engineering projects that
create positive impact. Students get the opportunity to perform design work and structural
calculations, use AutoCAD, calculate material quantities and costs, create construction Gantt
charts and write professional reports.
Since 2017, WEIA has partnered with 9 universities to build 7 bridges in 2 countries. These
projects have helped over 15,800 people in underserved communities gain year-round access
to water, health care, education, jobs and markets. As a university chapter of EIA, our team at
Western University strives to fund, design, and construct a new footbridge every year for a
community in one of our project countries, Bolivia and Eswatini. We aim to create a global
impact, changing lives for the better of the locals living in these isolated communities while
developing engineering skills and immersing ourselves in new cultures. <br> <br>

<h2 style="font-size: 35px; margin-left: 30px; color: #5e2b97;"> WHY BRIDGES?</h2>
<p style="font-size: 22px; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
In the remote farmlands of the developing world, walking is the primary mode of transportation.
The World Bank estimates that a billion people in low-income countries around the world lack
access to a road that is passable year-round, largely due to rainy seasons that are both critical to
agriculture and dangerous for the very people that rely on those seasonal rains. When rivers swell,
walks to school or work or visits to a doctor can become life-threatening without a bridge to cross.
Studies from rural communities throughout the world have demonstrated that access to safe and
reliable transportation networks has a dramatic effect on the ability of residents to meet their own
needs and care for their families. <br>
Footbridges result in... </p>
<p style="font-size: 22px; margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 40px;">
12% increase in children enrolled in school <br>
18% increase in healthcare treatment <br>
45% increase in fertilizer investment <br>
56% increase in crop yield <br>
75% increase in farm profits <br>
30% increase in labor market income <br>
59% increase of women in the labor market <br>
20% return on investment <br>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
This level of impact is unparalleled in the realm of community-level development projects!
Building on training received from Bridges to Prosperity, the EIA Bridge Program uses a
replicable model that leverages the resources and capacity of local governments and the
innovative design and construction technologies developed in partnership with top engineers to
create transformative change in access to education, health services, markets, and employment
for hundreds, or even thousands, of people at a time. Our model is focused on pairing innovative
bridge-building technology with the resources and capacity already present in a community to
create lasting, positive change, all while empowering our student participants to become lifetime
global change-makers.
